import method to test:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

RESULT SUCCESSFUL CASES:

Signed and unsigned ints and floats in same size lists in list matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6.7]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.35]]

    >>> matrix = [[-1.5], [-2.5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
    [[-0.6], [-1.0]]

    >>> matrix = [[True], [False]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, True)
    [[1.0], [0.0]]

RESULT FAILED CASES:

Empty matrix:
    >>> matrix_divided(None, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Different sized lists in matrix:

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

    >>> matrix = [[7, 9, 5], [10], [6, 8, 12]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
